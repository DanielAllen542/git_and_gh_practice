My hobbies are pretty simple, I'm an easy to please kind of guy with a grungy style.
I like to fish early some mornings to get my day going, and other days I like to get up at 1 pm.
Playing video games, traveling around and spontaneously hitting up the random hobby or interest is a way of life to me.
The random hobbies of mine would most likely include picking some random activity up to see if i like it or not.
For example there's been times where i picked up guitar for a bit and then skateboarding and almost every winter i snowboard.
My family refers to me as a Jack Of All Trades.
