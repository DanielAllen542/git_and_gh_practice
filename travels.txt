On of my favorite travel experiences was when I went on trip from Vegas to California with my buddies.
We did this multiple times, and this was a natural occurrence for us.
We would bum out on the beach or in our cars and sometimes we would manage to swipe ourselves a cheap camping spot for the day.
There wasn't much to it and we almost did absolutely nothing but for us but man, we had the times of our lives and will all be 
full of moments we never forget.
